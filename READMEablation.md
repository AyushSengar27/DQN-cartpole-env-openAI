## To run the file for ablation study : python experiment_ayush.py
# DQN is  DQN with TN and ER
# DQN-TN is DQN without TN
# DQN-ER is DQN without ER
# DQN-ER-TN is DQN without ER and TN

# Note : when you run the code you'll see green lines(a lot) on the terminal which indicate the epochs
# The code can take a lot of hours to run as it uses CPU version of tensorflow, for reference runninng the whole hyperprameter tuning code took 24+ hours on a 16gb windows machine.
